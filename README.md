### CNN

- Lenet-5<br>
    Classic CNN structure to classification. Introduced by Lecun. <br>
    An tensorflow implementation of Lenet-5 was writen to train on Cifar-10 dataset. 

### RNN

##### Basic Concepts
 - [Andrej Karpathy's lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX5V1WpxxkY) on RNNs and LSTMs from CS231n(Youtube).
 - [A great blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah on how LSTMs work.
 - [Building an RNN](http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-i.html)from the ground up in tensorflow.
